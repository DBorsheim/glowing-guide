# ELEGOO NEPTUNE 3 Pro Start G-code Configuration

This repository contains a customized start G-code for the ELEGOO NEPTUNE 3 Pro 3D printer. This G-code has been optimized to ensure smooth and reliable print starts by incorporating preheat, retraction, and mesh bed leveling processes. It is tailored to work with a single extruder setup and provides a robust sequence of commands to prime the nozzle and prepare the print bed effectively.

### Key Features:
- **Optimized Temperature Settings**: Preheats the nozzle to 210°C and the bed to 60°C with precise wait commands to ensure stable temperatures before printing.
- **Mesh Bed Leveling**: Automatically loads and applies the saved mesh leveling data for a perfect first layer.
- **Nozzle Priming**: Includes a line and circle priming routine to ensure consistent extrusion before starting the print.
- **Retract and Wipe**: Cleans the nozzle with retraction and wiping moves to prevent stringing and blobs.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Configurable retraction speeds, layer height, and travel speeds to adapt to various materials and print styles.

This start G-code is designed for users looking to streamline their 3D printing process on the ELEGOO NEPTUNE 3 Pro, providing an ideal foundation for high-quality prints.
